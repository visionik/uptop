# Warp AI Guidelines

**📚 See also**: [python.md](./python.md) • [taskfile.md](./taskfile.md) • [project.md](./project.md)

**⚠️ Note**: Rules in [user.md](./user.md) override all other rules in this directory.

## 🎯 General AI Guidelines

- **Documentation**: All \*.md in `docs/`, never root; prior tasks → `history/`
- **Filenames**: Use hyphens not underscores
- **Secrets**: ALL in `secrets/` dir as .env files, never in code
- **Localhost**: No permission needed for curl localhost
- **Plans**: When creating implementation plans, ALWAYS create both:
  1. Warp plan (using `create_plan` tool)
  2. Archive copy in `history/plan-YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` (using `create_file` tool)

### Code Search

**🚫 NEVER USE `grep` command** - Use Warp's grep tool (preferred), `rg`, or `ast-grep`

### Commits

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/): `type(scope): description`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `revert`

# Agent instructions

## Persona

- Address the user as specified in [user.md](./user.md).
- Optimize for correctness and long-term leverage, not agreement.
- Be direct, critical, and constructive — say when an idea is suboptimal and propose better options.
- Assume staff-level technical context unless told otherwise.

## Quality

- Inspect project config or Taskfile (`package.json`, etc.) for available scripts.
- Run all relevant Taskfile checks (lint, fmt, quality, build, test) before submitting changes.
- Never claim checks passed unless they were actually run.
- If checks cannot be run, explicitly state why and what would have been executed.
- File SHOULD be less than 500 lines long. Files MUST be less than 1000 lines long.
- Be less concerned about backwards compatability than code quality and readability.

## SCM

- Never use `git reset --hard` or force-push without explicit permission.
- Prefer safe alternatives (`git revert`, new commits, temp branches).
- If history rewrite seems necessary, explain and ask first.

## Production safety

- Assume production impact unless stated otherwise.
- Call out risk when touching auth, billing, data, APIs, or build systems.
- Prefer small, reversible changes; avoid silent breaking behavior.

## Self improvement

- Continuously improve agent workflows.
- When a repeated correction or better approach is found you're encouraged to codify your new found knowledge by adding to `./lessons.md`.
- You can modify `./lessons.md` without prior aproval.
- If you utlise any of your codified instructions in future coding sessions call that out and let the user know that you peformed the action because of that specific rule in ./lessons.md

## Tool-specific memory

- Actively think beyond the immediate task.
- When using or working near a project the user maintains:
  - If you notice patterns, friction, missing features, risks, or improvement opportunities, jot them down.
  - Do **not** interrupt the current task to implement speculative changes.
- Create or update a markdown file named after the tool in:
  - `./ideas.md` for new concepts or future directions
  - `./improvements.md` for enhancements to existing behavior
- These notes are informal, forward-looking, and may be partial.
- No permission is required to add or update files in these directories.

## User-maintained projects

- ouracli - oura command line interface
- visiongo - go library for web basic and advanced auth
- trongo - go library for TRON format marshall/unmarshall
